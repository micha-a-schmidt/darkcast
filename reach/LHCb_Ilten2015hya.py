This limit is a projection for LHCb searches using a di-electron final
state from D*0 -> D0 A' decays and cannot be used for recasting, but
is provided for reference. Three bounds are provided,
'LHCb_Ilten2015hya_prompt.lmt', 'LHCb_Ilten2015hya_pre.lmt', and
'LHCb_Ilten2015hya_post.lmt' corresponding to the prompt, displaced
