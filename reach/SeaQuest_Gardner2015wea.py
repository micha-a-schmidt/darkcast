This limit is a projection for SeaQuest searches using di-electron and
di-muon final states. Four bounds are provided,
'SeaQuest_Gardner2015wea_eta_ee.lmt',
'SeaQuest_Gardner2015wea_eta_mumu.lmt',
'SeaQuest_Gardner2015wea_brem_ee.lmt', and
'SeaQuest_Gardner2015wea_brem_mumu.lmt'. The first two bounds are from
eta decays, while the second two are from proton bremsstrahlung. These
limits were extracted from figure 2 (red hashed fills) of
Gardner:2015wea.
