This limit is a projection for LHCb searches using an inclusive
di-muon final state and cannot be used for recasting, but is provided
for reference. Two prompt bounds are provided,
'LHCb_Ilten2016tkc_prompt_15ifb.lmt' and
'LHCb_Ilten2016tkc_prompt_300ifb', corresponding to the expected
luminosity of 15 fb^-1 at the end of LHC Run 3 and 300 fb^-1 at the
end of the HL-LHC. Similarly, to displaced bounds are provided,
'LHCb_Ilten2016tkc_displaced_15ifb.lmt' and
'LHCb_Ilten2016tkc_displaced_300ifb'. These limits were provided by
the authors.
